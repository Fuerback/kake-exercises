# Exercise 1

## Description

Given a 2D array of integers, write a function that returns a 1D array containing the sum of each column.

In other words, you should sum all the values of the first index of each array and return it as the first index of the output array. Do the same for the second index, and so on.

Implement the function `sumColValues`.

## Example

```go
input := [][]int{
	{1, 2, 3},
	{4, 5},
  {},
	{7, 8, 9},
}

output := []int{12, 15, 12}
```
